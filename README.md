# PorkyPowers-Refactored
 
Welcome! If you made it here, you're probably interested in making a mod of Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning. Please open this Project in Unity 2019.4.21f1. This Project was forked from [itch.io](https://porkypowers.itch.io/baldi-open-source-classic-party).

## Credits
GunnableScum: Refactored the decompile.
Porky Powers: Fixed the decompile.
mystman12 and Basically games: Owner and Creator of Baldi's Basics.  
Jumpman25: Made the original decompiles.
SplintaDinta: Baldi Model  
MissingTextureMan101: Made Open Source Baldi.

## Have a Problem?
If you have a problem with the base game (that's not mod code), please open an issue! I'd be happy to modify the code and fix this problem.

## Have a recommendation or you know how to improve comments or code?
If you do, please fork this repository, commit your changes to it and open a pull request! If I feel like your changes are sufficient, I will happily merge your changes into the codebase.

## Contributors list
None yet, if you feel like contributing, please open a pull request.

## Additional Information
I originally wanted to finish this on the 31st March, as an anniversary thing, but oh well, happy late Birthday, Baldi!
Also I made this because I was bored and Ronezkj15 complained so this kept me busy for a few hours, I guess.
